    "## 0. Motivation of Factor Models <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"0\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Factors models are widely used in industry and serve two main purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is to reduce the complexity of modeling asset price movements.  For instance, trying to build a model that completely explains stock price movements is near impossible.  In order to build a model for your favorite stock one would need to model supply, demand, sentiment, current and expected future earnings of the stock, news, interest rates, risk premia...\n",
    "\n",
    "It's near impossible to calibrate such a complicated model!  Instead, factor investors assume that there are N important factors that drive a portion of the asset returns.  They then say that at the portfolio level, asset specific movements can be averaged out, and only those N variables remain.  So to understand what drives the portfolio returns we only need to model the effect of that small number of factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternativly, understanding the factor loadings of the individual assets allows us to estimate the covariance of our returns.  We state without proof that if one understands the factor loadings and the covariance of the factor returns, one can then compute an estimate for the covariance of the assets themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally factor models can also be used for hedging.  We again state without proof that the factor loadings represent the hedging ratio one would use to minimize the volatility of your portfolio.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module we will walk though multiple ways of estimating factor loadings, and discuss their relative strenghts and weaknesses."

    "$t$ is used to index each observation. ${\\bf y} = \\{y_t\\}$ is called the dependent variable for observation $t$ and the vector ${X_t}^T = (X_t^1, X_t^2, \\dots, X_t^m)$ is called the set of factors (statisticians would call them independent or explanatory variables) for observation $t$. \n",
    "\n",
    "${\\bf \\beta} = (\\beta_1,\\dots,\\beta_m)'$ are called the factor loadings.\n",
    "\n",
    "As in most of finance, the dependent variable $y_t$ will the be the returns of some asset, and the independent variables will the the return of the factors.  We call this a linear factor model because we have assumed a linear relationship between the returns of the factors and the returns of the assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "With historical data, the factor loadings ${\\bf \\beta}$ can be estimated via Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation:\n",
    "\n",

    "If $y_t$ represent an asset return at time t, the linear factor model can help us interpret the source of the asset return and attribute it to the factor returns.\n",

    "1) World Equity: This factor represents worldwide equity returns.\n",

    "3) Bond Risk Premia: This is a credit factor that captures extra yield from risky bonds.  Defined as the spread between high risk bonds and US Treasury bonds.\n",

Regularized regression means that we add a penalty term to the optimization problem to penalize the model's complexity.  For the sake of intuition, imagine if we could penalize the number of non zero coeficients we add to the model.  In that instance we would expect that the model would only consider the variables that really influence Y, and ignore the noise variables.  LASSO regression (defined below) does exactly that.\n",
